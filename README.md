# pEuler3
Solves Project Euler problem 3, determinig the largest prime factor of 600,851,475,143
The current implementation brute force checks every prime, and its method of finding the primes is also to check every number.
Improvements to be made are to change nextHighestPrime to only check numbers in the form 6n+1 and 6n-1
